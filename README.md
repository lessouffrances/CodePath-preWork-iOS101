**An app I'd like to build**
**App Idea: Health & Wellness Tracker**

I would like to develop a Health & Wellness Tracker app that combines features from various health and fitness applications. This app aims to provide users with a comprehensive platform for tracking their physical and mental well-being. Key features include personalized workout plans, a nutrition tracker with meal suggestions, and mental health check-ins. The app will leverage machine learning to analyze user data and provide insights, such as suggesting optimal workout routines based on personal goals and preferences. Additionally, it will integrate social features, allowing users to connect with friends, share achievements, and participate in challenges for added motivation. The goal is to create a holistic wellness experience that addresses both physical and mental health needs.

## Notes
**Challenges that I encountered during this preWork**

This is a simple storyboard app outlet, and the only challenge that I encountered was to control and drag the button to the view control file.
